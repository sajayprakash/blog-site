Education is without a doubt the most essential thing for everybody. Without education, we would live in a world without organization, thinking and proper decision making. Many countries understand this and educate their students through their education systems. However not all do it right, India being one of them. For decades the Indian education system remains unchanged with the ever-evolving change in society, technological advances and political problems. The core fundamental concepts are outdated and we still follow a very theoretical approach to learning. We do not follow **Learn by Doing** principles.

The Indian Education System is so flawed and fails to make us *'Industry Ready'*. Those who are successful are the ones who had to learn beyond the textbooks. The system as it is today makes us mug-up and throw up on the paper. We are awarded marks based on how well you can memorize what's given in the textbooks. Your practical skills are not awarded anything, often even the practical exams are manipulated in a way that prioritizes people who can rewrite the textbooks on the answer sheet.

Education should go beyond textbooks and exams. It should strive to nurture well-rounded individuals by incorporating co-curricular activities, sports, and vocational training. The Indian education system's heavy emphasis on academic performance overlooks the importance of physical, social, and emotional development, leading to an imbalance in overall growth.

Creativity is killed at a young age. Instead of teaching to innovate, we are taught to reproduce already existing solutions. There is no appreciation for creative thinkers, awards given only to someone able to score **600/600** on a bunch of useless theory papers that they can never explain what they learnt from it.

This system will never change, from the corrupt government to the useless professors who scroll through power-point presentations without even knowing themselves what the topic they are teaching means. This system is bound to collapse and create a population that can reproduce existing solutions but not rethink and innovate. I have spent over a decade in this system and learnt how well the human brain can store textbooks texts for a short period of time. I had to work twice as hard to learn my practical skills and build amazing websites like the blog site you are reading this on!

*Of course how can we forget the garbage institution management, rules, code of conduct and some horrible professors with wonderful ego, we'll get back to that once I graduate* ðŸ¤«
