Welcome to my blog site! I'm excited to share my journey of learning web development with you through this platform.As a newbie in web development, I have been exploring various frameworks and technologies to build websites. Recently, I stumbled upon AstroJS and ReactJS so, I decided to use these technologies to create my blog site, and I must say, I am quite happy with the results.

I was previously using Hugo and I still recommend using that for static sites but I wanted to learn JS Frameworks which is why I switched to AstroJS.

AstroJS is a framework that allows developers to create fast and modern websites using a static-site generation approach. By combining AstroJS and ReactJS, I was able to create a fast and responsive blog site with a modern UI. The static site generation approach of AstroJS allowed me to pre-render all the pages of my site, making it lightning fast. I used ReactJS for building the UI components and Tailwind CSS for CSS framework, which made it easy to reuse them across different pages. This website was heavily inspired by Takuya Matsuyama from devaslife. I've been following and watching him for a long time on his platforms.
